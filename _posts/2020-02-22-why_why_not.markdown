My reasons for coding are private, allow me to ellaborate:

My why for getting in to coding really have to do with the challenge that is learning a language I don't have an organic interest in. I've picked up some Java, some HTML, even a little C++ out of necessity when learning software but, never really enjoyed the art of writing as an art itself. I'm here to see how many characters I'm made of.
